I am Qile Wang, a Ph.D. candidate at the Ocean College, Zhejiang University. Currently, I am a visiting Ph.D.  at the Instituto Dom Luiz (IDL), Lisbon University. My research focuses on marine environmental sensing based on fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). Specifically, my work involves submarine cable routing and fault detection, joint observation of hydroacoustic and geoacoustic wavefields, and the monitoring and application of whale vocalizations.

In my spare time, I usually enjoy long-distance running and cooking gourmet food.
