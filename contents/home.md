I am Qile Wang, a Ph.D. candidate at the Ocean College, Zhejiang University. Currently, I am a visiting Ph.D.  at the Instituto Dom Luiz (IDL), University of Lisbon. My research focuses on marine environment sensing based on fiber-optic distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). Specifically, my work involves submarine cable route and breakage detection, joint observation of hydroacoustic and geoacoustic wavefields, and the monitoring and application of whale vocalization.

In my spare time, I usually enjoy long-distance running and cooking Chinese food.
